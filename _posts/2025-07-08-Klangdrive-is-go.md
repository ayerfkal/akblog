# Project: Klangdrive
### Initial goal:
Convert 2012 MacBook Air to low-end Linux-based DJ and audio workstation using Arch Linux, Mixxx, Renoise, InkScape, GIMP, Audacity and Obsidian. 

**External hardware:**
- Reloop Mixage IE DJ controller (saved from scrapping, repaired and kicking!)
- USB Wifi card (built-in seems to crash w/ Linux)
- Behringer Sound Card

### Sub goals:
- Install Arch Linux on MacBook Air with full disk encryption
- Set up audio routing so that Renoise (or any application) can sample from browser and sound cards
- Make a drum n bass-ish track (172-180 bpm) in Renoise, 2:30 - 3:00 min (using only samples - no synths)
- Do a 20-25 min drum & bass DJ set with Mixxx and Mixage with tracks from "Together with Ukraine" (and my track ofc)
	- Figure out how to record the set (internally?)
- Create logo/image (in Arch) for whenever I post the mix and track
- Create blog and post progress of project every day

Progress so far:
- (repaired the controller)
- created USB for installing Arch
- found charger for MacBook
- created blog
- posted first post
