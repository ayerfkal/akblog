# Project: Klangdrive

Today's goal:
Install Arch on my MacBook Air - full disk encryption, swap file instead of partition, unencrypted EFI partition.

### Choosing file system
I'm a novice in file systems for Linux - after a quick online research (or rather search) I've concluded that ext4 is sufficient.
I also consulted ChatGPT, which gave me the following answer - in line with my (re)search:

"**EXT4: Best choice if you want:** simplicity, stability, low maintenance, and proven reliability."

So ext4 it is.

Let's move on.

### Installing Arch Linux
*If [PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0) can do it, so can I*.

Installation process seem to be straight forward, following the official wiki installation guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide

First issue was figuring out correct keymap - after some trial-and-error it seems like apple-a1243-sv was the correct one for my Swedish Mac.
I tried a few other mac and Apple-related maps, but they were all completely wrong.
"> " and "<" are in the wrong places, but that's ok.

And while fiddling with fdisk, wiki.archlinux.org stopped respondning - coincidence, or a sign to stop this silliness.
Lets have a break.

An hour later and we're back.
I went for this solution:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LVM_on_LUKS


So, everything was going according to plan (at least that's what I thought) - setting up LVM and encryption and what not, feeling like Linux expert.

Apparently I missed a step or two, and got an error at boot:
```
ERROR: device '/dev/mapper/VolumeGroup-root' not found. Skipping fsck.
/.../
You are now being dropped into an emergency shell.
```

And some more error messages.

So, I started from scratch - still confused.
Found another [guide](https://whhone.com/posts/arch-linux-full-disk-encryption/) that does not seem to use LVM - think I need to read up on some terminology.

So, today I made no measurable progress. But I did learn that I know less than I thought about Linux.

Goal not met. PewDiePie: 1 - Ayerfkal: 0
